-- Migration: Allow quantity=0 in bank_storage for RS3-style placeholders
-- When a player withdraws all of an item, the row stays with quantity=0
-- to reserve the bank slot (placeholder). The previous constraint (>=1)
-- blocked this, causing withdraw failures.

ALTER TABLE bank_storage DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS bank_quantity_positive;
