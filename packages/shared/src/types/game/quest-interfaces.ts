/**
 * Quest System Interfaces
 *
 * Defines segregated interfaces for different aspects of quest functionality.
 * This follows Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) - callers only depend
 * on the methods they actually need.
 *
 * **Interface Overview:**
 * - `IQuestQuery` - Read-only quest information queries
 * - `IQuestProgress` - Active quest progress tracking
 * - `IQuestActions` - Quest state mutation actions
 *
 * **Usage:**
 * Handlers that only need to check quest status use `IQuestQuery`.
 * Systems that need to start/complete quests use `IQuestActions`.
 * This reduces coupling and makes dependencies explicit.
